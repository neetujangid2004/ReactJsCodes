What is React ?
->  JavaScript Library for building fast and interactive UI
->  Developed by Facebook in 2011
->  React is the view layer of an MVC application (Model View Controller)
->  Declarative View - React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
->  Component Based - Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

Why React ?
->  Virtual DOM tree
            Real DOM                         
1.  It updates slow.
2.  Can directly update HTML.
3.  Creates a new DOM if element updates.
4.  DOM manipulation is very expensive.
5.  Too much of memory wastage.

            Virtual DOM
1.  It updates faster.
2.  Can't directly update HTML.
3.  Updates the JSX if element update.
4.  DOM manipulation is very easy.
5.  No memory wastage.

Virtual DOM tree    -->     State change    -->     Real DOM
